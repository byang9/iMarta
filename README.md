# iMarta
iMarta is a program that would help assist Marta employees detect fights and trash in real time. It combines the power of AI and the many Marta cameras to create a safer and cleaner environment for Marta riders.
## The Technology
The technologies we used to develop iMarta consisted of [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/), and Python's OpenCV. We developed the code in Python, and used OpenCV to control the laptop camera and send frames to Clarifai. To train our AI we took over 200 photos and ran it through Clarifai's training process before testing our model in the python script. In the end our product was able to detect fighting scenes and trash on the floor.
